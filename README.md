## About the Program

This is a console-based application that currently focuses on backend functionality for storing and retrieving information.
The program is operated through a simple menu system (options 1, 2, 3, 4, …), organized into clear categories for an easier user experience.
It is built using SQL Server (SSMS), Visual Studio, and Entity Framework, and follows an ER diagram that will be presented further below.
